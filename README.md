CSVDisinfect
============

Basic/boring tool to remove special charactes from existing CSV Files.  Used as a learning tool for C#.

Depending on future needs/usage, the cleaning criteria may be made into a menu or allow for raw regex entry.

Currently this is very strict, only allowing a-z, A-Z, 0-9, ",", " " - Alpha, Num, Comma, Space
